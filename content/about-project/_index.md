## What's This About?

This project has a simple goal: making public data on COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in The Bahamas available, accessible and consumable.

Finding information on a global pandemic and how it affects your country shouldn't be that hard, but here we are. The Bahamas is not a real place.

Even more so, being able to access that data on your desktop, your tablet or your mobile device shouldn't require downloading files and hogging up precious space... that's what the web is for. 

Besides, it's 2021. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEC-8GFTP4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ain't nobody got time for that!</a>

## Who's It For?

Everybody.

It's our hope that whether it's viewing this site directly or accessing the API, everybody can use it: over breakfast, eating lunch, planning dinner... you see where this is going.

We're also hoping that this data will be beneficial to instutions — like hospitals, research labs, colleges and universities — that rely on data like this to create models, forecasts and projections.

It's even being used to help teach high school kids how to code.

So... everybody.

## Help Us Out?

Well, nothing in life is really free and there's so much more that we'd like to do, but it takes time, effort and money.

We need your support to dedicate our time and effort to updating this site and the API with all available [COVID-19 Case Report](/reports) and [COVID-19 Vaccination Update](/updates) data, continue developing and maintaining this site, add new features and just old fashioned pay the bills — this thing's coming outta' pocket.

Your help can help us continue making this resource available to you and the rest of The Bahamas.
